# EtherCAT Workbench

[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

An EtherCAT slave debugging and diagnostics workbench for Windows. The desktop application uses **Tauri 2, Rust, React, TypeScript, Material UI, and Emotion**. Python owns the EtherCAT hardware core behind a persistent local JSON bridge; the WebView never accesses pySOEM directly.

This project uses [pySOEM](https://github.com/bnjmnp/pysoem) for EtherCAT master communication. Real mode on Windows depends on the official [Npcap](https://npcap.com/) driver; Npcap is not included in this repository or application.

> [!WARNING]
> The application defaults to **Real** mode, but startup does not open an adapter, connect, scan the bus, or write hardware automatically. Demo/Mock is enabled only in Settings and remains visibly marked. Real-mode state transitions, register writes, and EEPROM operations can affect machinery or make a slave temporarily unavailable. Use an isolated, recoverable test setup.

## Why EtherCAT Workbench

EtherCAT Workbench brings bus discovery, state diagnostics, ESC register inspection, and EEPROM maintenance into one desktop workflow while isolating hardware requests in one communication Worker. CoE, PDO mapping, and online I/O code remains in the repository but those pages are hidden from the current public navigation.

| Concern | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Safe first contact | Real mode does not auto-connect; Demo/Mock is enabled only in Settings and is clearly marked |
| Responsive UI | The WebView never calls pySOEM; hardware work runs asynchronously in the Python bridge |
| Request consistency | One Worker serializes requests for one Master |
| Write control | Registers use two-stage plans and readback; EEPROM uses capacity, structure, semantic, and full-image verification |
| Hardware-free development | Mock backend, Demo data, and automated tests require no EtherCAT device |
| Traceability | UI progress, JSONL logs, and `AUDIT` write records retain diagnostic context |

## User guide

### Windows and Npcap requirements

Real mode is pinned to the official Windows wheel `pysoem==1.1.13`. It requires:

- Windows 10/11 x64;
- Node.js 20 or newer, pnpm/Corepack, Rust MSVC, and WebView2 for source builds;
- Python 3.11 or newer;
- Npcap 1.88 or newer with **WinPcap API-compatible Mode** enabled;
- administrator/raw-packet access to the selected adapter;
- preferably, a dedicated EtherCAT adapter that carries no ordinary network traffic.

The application reports actionable errors when Npcap/wpcap is missing, permissions are insufficient, or an adapter cannot be opened. Demo/Mock does not open a physical adapter.

### Install and run

Release builds use the Tauri 2 Windows bundle flow and produce only an NSIS (`.exe`) installer with a Simplified Chinese installer and uninstaller UI; MSI packages are no longer built or published. Npcap is not bundled, and the Python runtime with `pysoem==1.1.13` must be prepared separately. Run in PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LINLin190/EtherCAT-Workbench.git
Set-Location "EtherCAT-Workbench\apps\EtherCAT Workbench"
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.\start-desktop.ps1
```

You can also double-click `Start-EtherCAT-Workbench.cmd`. The launcher prefers global pnpm, a locally cached Corepack version, or Corepack, and removes only project-owned stale Vite processes before startup. Vite uses port `1420`; an unrelated process holding it is reported and left untouched.

### Recommended workflow

The public workflow is `1. Detect adapter -> 2. Connect -> 3. Scan -> 4. Select slave -> 5. Read state and AL -> 6. Register or EEPROM diagnostics`.

1. In Real mode, detect and select the EtherCAT adapter; Demo/Mock is enabled in Settings.
2. Click **Connect**, then **Scan**, and select the target in the slave tree.
3. Read actual state and AL status first. Request states in the normal sequence `INIT -> PRE-OP -> SAFE-OP -> OP`; state, reconfigure, recovery, and EEPROM controls are unavailable during cyclic communication.
4. In Registers, read before writing and confirm the slave, catalog, address, current value, and target value. Regenerate plans older than 60 seconds.
5. For EEPROM, stop cyclic communication and put the target in INIT. Back up a BIN first, then select XML/Device, inspect Smart View and capacity, and program or restore.

### Implemented functionality

- adapter detection and selection, manual connect/disconnect, scan, identities, AL status, direct state requests, reconfigure, and recovery;
- ESC register catalogs for ET1100, LAN9252, and LAN9253 with search, categories, bit fields, raw access, monitoring, change highlighting, and copy;
- two-stage register writes bound to slave identity, with semantic readback and `AUDIT` logging;
- ESI XML selection, drag and drop, five recent files, multiple Device entries, SII generation, Smart View, and capacity checks;
- complete EEPROM reads, BIN backups, changed-word writes, per-word readback, settling wait, full reread, byte/SHA-256/structure/identity-semantic validation, and BIN restore;
- exclusive three-frame ESC ECAT reset using `0x0040 <- 0x52/0x45/0x53`, bounded rediscovery polling, and separate rediscovery/reload results;
- persistent JSONL logs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\EtherCATWorkbench\logs`; every write operation is recorded as `AUDIT`.

## AL status codes

Overview reads the ESC standard AL status register `0x0134` and shows the code, name, details, and troubleshooting action. Use **Settings -> AL status language** to switch between Chinese and English; the choice is persisted locally.

| Range/code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0x0000` | No error |
| `0x0001`-`0x0083`, `0x00F0` | Built-in common catalog covering firmware/SII, state transitions, mailbox, SyncManager, PDO, watchdog, synchronization, DC, power, temperature, and application-controller conditions |
| `0x8000`-`0xFFFF` | Vendor-specific; the UI does not guess its meaning. Consult the device manual, ESI, and vendor diagnostic objects |
| Other values | Unlisted, reserved, or newer extension candidates; reread `0x0134` and consult device documentation |

`0x0050` means **EEPROM no access**. This code alone does not prove PDI ownership or an EEPROM lock, and `0x0500 == 0` is not positive proof. Read `0x0500`, `0x0501`, and `0x0502` together and correlate ownership, Busy/error bits, firmware state, logs, and captures. `0x0051` is more consistent with an EEPROM read/write, acknowledgement, or verification failure. State-transition errors include the slave name, actual state, and AL code.

## EEPROM safety rules

EEPROM programming is allowed only with cyclic communication stopped and the target slave in INIT. Identity mismatches are warnings only and do not require an extra confirmation. The selected XML/Device fully defines the target image; XML text is never written directly, and old Serial Number, Station Alias, or private data is not silently merged.

Invalid XML, failed SII generation, unreadable or mismatched physical capacity, running cyclic communication, another EEPROM operation, or communication failure blocks the operation. During programming or restore, other hardware commands immediately return `EEPROM_BUSY`. Cancellation is shown neutrally as **Cancelled**. Verification details include the `first_difference` offset, and the complete backup path is shown after backup.

`image_success` is true only when complete readback is byte-for-byte identical to the target, both SHA-256 values match, SII structure is valid, and XML semantic validation passes. Reset rediscovery and reload failures are reported separately and do not alter completed image verification.

### ESI-to-SII conversion boundary

Supported: ConfigData/CRC-8, Identity, standard Mailbox, Strings, General, FMMU, SyncManager, RxPDO/TxPDO, DC OpMode, standard primitive CoE types, and BIT1-BIT8. Vendor-private Categories, a complete custom DataTypes dictionary, EoE/FoE-specific data, and arbitrary complete ESI Schema coverage are not claimed; omissions are reported rather than silently ignored. Smart View shows category, type, offset, length, and content preview.

## ESC profiles and identification

`chip_model` and `register_family` are stored separately. Profiles include E101, E252, E253, ET1100, LAN9252, LAN9253, and Generic ESC; domestic models are not displayed as original vendor chips. Identification uses ESI model text or chip-type register `0x0E00`, not guesses from FMMU/SM counts or RAM ranges. Vendor-specific registers, exact encodings, EEPROM timing, and reset compatibility for E101/E252/E253 remain unverified on physical hardware.

## Developer guide

### Architecture principles

- React pages handle presentation and interaction; Tauri Rust handles desktop lifecycle and bridging.
- The Python bridge is the only hardware entry point; the WebView never calls pySOEM directly.
- EtherCatWorker is the sole Backend owner and serializes hardware requests for one Master.
- Mock and Real backends share an interface; Mock does not claim physical verification.
- EEPROM exclusivity, state checks, confirmations, and verification are enforced in the service/backend layers. A successful `recover()` is followed by actual-state and AL-status verification.

### Build the Windows application

Maintainers can build the Simplified Chinese NSIS Windows installer locally from the `desktop` directory:

```powershell
Set-Location desktop
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Before distributing an application bundle, verify WebView2, the Python bridge, pySOEM, and Npcap deployment boundaries on Windows x64. Npcap is never bundled.

### Tests and build checks

Automated tests use only the Mock backend and included ESI/BIN fixtures. They do not open a physical adapter or write real PDO outputs, EEPROM, or registers.

```powershell
python -m ruff check src tests
python -m pytest -q
Set-Location desktop
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

Current visual acceptance targets are `2560 x 1440` (default), `1920 x 1080`, and `1280 x 720` (minimum window size).

## Current limitations and physical verification

> [!CAUTION]
> Passing Mock tests does not establish physical EtherCAT hardware verification.

- Npcap opening, real state transitions, EEPROM timing, and complex-topology rediscovery after reset require an isolated test device;
- the firmware/PDI paths behind INIT-to-PRE-OP `0x0050`/`0x0051` require device documentation or captures;
- vendor bit fields, private registers, and exact chip encodings for E101/E252/E253 require datasheets or hardware captures;
- vendor-private SII Categories and arbitrary complete ESI Schema conversion are outside the current support claim;
- CoE, PDO mapping, and online I/O pages are hidden in this release; the standard register catalog does not claim complete coverage of every vendor extension.

For first physical contact, use read-only steps: enumerate adapters, connect, scan, read state/AL, read registers, and read and store an EEPROM BIN offline. Confirm that the backup parses and that the equipment is safe before validating writes on an isolated test slave.

## Safety notice

EtherCAT state, register, and EEPROM writes can affect machinery or make a slave temporarily unavailable. Verify the selected slave and address before each write, keep a known-good EEPROM backup, and ensure connected equipment is in a safe state.
